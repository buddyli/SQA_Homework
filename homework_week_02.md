#Summmary of week 2

##Quality Assurance in Context
In this chapter, we mainly discussed about the importance of the defect tracking and handling in quality assurance. Also, 
the author taught us how to define a defect handing process, and measurements that can be taken during QA activites. At 
last, we talk about verification and validation(V&V).

##Quality Engineering
The author mainly discussed about the differenct between quality assurance and quality engineering, the importance of
quantification of quality, and the quality engineering effort profile would be somewhat different from that quality strategy other than waterfall are used.

##TESTING:CONCEPTS, ISSUES, AND TECHNIQUES
Testing process, major test activites, testing models and different roles in software development teams.

##TEST ACTIVITIES, MANAGEMENT, AND AUTO MATI0N
A detailed look of all the major test activities, such as test planning and preparation, test execution and measurement, 
roles and responsbilites of different people when doing this, and also issues of test automation.

##COVERAGE AND USAGE TESTING BASED ON CHECKLISTS AND PARTITIONS
All of the test techniques described in this chapter are based on simple structures such as lists and partitions. The 
author mainly talked about the advantages and disadvantages about those techniques.

##INPUT DOMAIN PARTITIONING AND BOUNDARY TESTING
Almost for each project, when we do test, firstly we would focus on input domain partitiong and boundary testing. The author mainly talked about possible input domain partitions and related partition coverage testing ideas, and then several important boundary testing strategies, at last the author extend the above strategies and generalize boundary testing for testing based on other boundary-like situations.
