##Quality Assurance in Context
In this chapter, we mainly discussed about the importance of the defect tracking and handling in quality assurance. Also, 
the author taught us how to define a defect handing process, and measurements that can be taken during QA activites. At 
last, we talk about verification and validation(V&V).
