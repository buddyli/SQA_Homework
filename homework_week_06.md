#pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives
Broadly speaking, a comparison of QA alternatives, together with related techniques and activities, is a cost-benefit analysis under the overall environment for software development or long-term maintenance. Consequently, the questions and comparison criteria can be classified into three broad categories of cost, benefit, and environment.

####In general, a concerted effort is necessary with many different QA activities to be used in an integrated fashion to effectively and efficiently deal with defects and ensure product quality.

####Defect prevention greatly reduces the chance of fault injections. Therefore, such preventiveactions should be an integral part of any QA plan. Causal analyses covered in Chapter 20 can be performed to identify systematic problems and select specific preventive actions to deal with the identified problems.

####Inspection and testing are applicable to different situations, and effective for different defect types at different defect levels. Therefore, inspection can be performed first to lower defect levels by directly detecting and removing many localized and static faults, then testing can be performed to remove the remaining faults related to dy-namic scenarios and interactions. To maximize the benefit-to-cost ratio, various risk identification techniques covered in Chapter 21 can be used to focus inspection and testing effort on identified high-risk product components.

####Software safety assurance (especially hazard and damage control), fault tolerance, and formal verification techniques cost significantly more to implement than traditional QA techniques. However, if consequence of failures is severe and potential damage is high, they can be used to further reduce the failure probability, or to reduce the accident probability or severity.
